## My process
 - Looked at the design and created semantic markup based on it
 - created CSS using the mobile first approach. This particular design didn't have anything different between the mobile and desktop version, so it was a relatively easy task

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Nothing much really, but I have adopted the idea of putting margin on one side on text elements (which could have top and bottom margin - so I would set top margin to 0 and then say 2rem for margin bottom). This produces consistance spacing
